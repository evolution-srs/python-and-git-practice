    "In this exercise, you will learn about the three primary methods of applying CSS to HTML:\n",
    "* inline CSS.\n",
    "* internal CSS.\n",
    "* external CSS.\n",
    "* practice implementing each method with examples to understand their differences and use cases.\n",

    "#### Types of CSS and Their Descriptions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Inline CSS**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Applied directly within an HTML element's style attribute\n",
    "* Ideal for quick styling of a single element  \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "* Example use case: Highlighting a specific word or line with unique styling  \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "* Pros: Simple to use for small changes\n",
    "* Cons: Difficult to maintain for larger projects; violates separation of content and style\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Internal CSS**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Defined within the **style** tag in the **head** section of the HTML document\n",
    "* Best for styling specific to a single HTML page  \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "* Example use case: Designing a webpage where styles aren't shared across multiple pages  \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "* Pros: Allows centralized styling for one document\n",
    "* Cons: Not reusable across multiple files\n",
    "\n",
    "3. External CSS\n",
    "\n",
    "* Written in a separate .css file and linked to the HTML using a **link tag\n",
    "* Preferred for websites with multiple pages requiring consistent styling  \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "* Example use case: Large websites where styles are shared across pages  \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "* Pros: Promotes reusability and cleaner code; separation of concerns\n",
    "* Cons: Requires an extra HTTP request to load the CSS file"
