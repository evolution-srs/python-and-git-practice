    "* HTML comments are used to include information in your code that is not to be displayed in your browser. This tag provides a way to document your source code and give more information about the code thus, enabling other users to understand the purpose of the code when working on a large database with other developers.\n",

    "To insert a comment into your code, use the comment tag <!-- [YOUR COMMENT HERE] -->, replacing [YOUR COMMENT HERE] with your comment. There are no limitations to what your comment could be, it can be text (both single-line and multi-line) or even other additional HTML tags.\n",

    "<div>\n",

    "The <div> tag defines a division of the page, and is used to group content together. Any type of content can be placed in a div tag, and it is not necessary that it should be semantically related.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div> tags are commonly used when many elements are required to have the same format. Grouping such elements together in the same <div> tag enables a developer to easily style them by either using a class or an id.\n",

    "When using a <div> tag, note that browsers will insert a line break before and after the element.:\n",
