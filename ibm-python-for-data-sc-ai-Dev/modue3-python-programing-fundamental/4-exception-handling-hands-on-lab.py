# Exception Hnaling Hands-on Lab

# What is an Exception?
# An exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the
# normal flow of the program's instructions.
# When an exception occurs, the program stops executing and raises an error message.

# Run each piece of code and observe the exception raised
