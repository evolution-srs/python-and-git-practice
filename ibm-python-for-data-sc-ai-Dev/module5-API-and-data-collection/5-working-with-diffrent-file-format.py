# 1- Data Engineering: is s one of the most critical and foundational skills in any data scientistâ€™s toolkit.

# 2- Data Engineering Process
# There are several steps in Data Engineering process:
# 1- Extract - Data extraction is getting data from multiple sources. 
# Ex. Data extraction from a website using Web scraping or gathering information from the data that are stored in different formats
# (JSON, CSV, XLSX etc.).

# 2- Transform - Transforming the data means removing the data that we don't need for further analysis and converting the data in the format 
# that all the data from the multiple sources is in the same format.

# 3- Load - Loading the data inside a data warehouse. Data warehouse essentially contains large volumes of data that are accessed to gather insights.

# 3- Working with different file formats
#In the real-world, people rarely get neat tabular data. Thus, it is mandatory for any data scientist (or data engineer) to be aware of 
# different file formats, common challenges in handling them and the best, most efficient ways to handle this data in real life. 
# We have reviewed some of this content in other modules.
