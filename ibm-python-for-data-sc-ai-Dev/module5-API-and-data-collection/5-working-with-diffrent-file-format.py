# 1- Data Engineering: is s one of the most critical and foundational skills in any data scientistâ€™s toolkit.

# 2- Data Engineering Process
# There are several steps in Data Engineering process:
# 1- Extract - Data extraction is getting data from multiple sources. 
# Ex. Data extraction from a website using Web scraping or gathering information from the data that are stored in different formats
# (JSON, CSV, XLSX etc.).

# 2- Transform - Transforming the data means removing the data that we don't need for further analysis and converting the data in the format 
# that all the data from the multiple sources is in the same format.

# 3- Load - Loading the data inside a data warehouse. Data warehouse essentially contains large volumes of data that are accessed to gather insights.

# 3- Working with different file formats
#In the real-world, people rarely get neat tabular data. Thus, it is mandatory for any data scientist
# (or data engineer) to be aware of different file formats, common challenges in handling them and 
# the best, most efficient ways to handle this data in real life. 

# A file format is a standardized method for encoding information to be stored in a computer file.

# 1- It specifies whether the file is binary or ASCII (text-based).

3 2-It dictates how the information is organized within the file (e.g., the Comma-Separated Values, or CSV format, organizes tabular data as plain text).

The file format can typically be identified by its file extension (e.g., a file named Data.csv indicates the CSV format).
