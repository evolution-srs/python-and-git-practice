    "\n",
    "JSON is built on two structures:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A collection of**name/value pairs**. In various languages, this is realized as an object, record, struct, dictionary, hash table, keyed list, or associative array.\n",
    "\n",
    "* An **ordered list of values**. In most languages, this is realized as an array, vector, list, or sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **JSON** is a language-independent data format. It was derived from **JavaScript**, but many modern programming languages include code to generate and parse JSON-format data. It is a very common data format with a diverse range of applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The text in JSON is done through quoted string which contains the values in key-value mappings within { }. It is similar to the dictionary in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Python supports JSON through a built-in package called json. To use this feature, we import the json package in Python script.\n"
